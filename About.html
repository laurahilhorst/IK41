<p style="text-align:left;"><b><h1>How does RHAPSODY work?</h1></b></p>

<p>
RHAPSODY is a forum for and about music, musicians and music gear. This is your place to discuss, advice and take advise from people all over the music industry. Did no one except your showerhead hear you sing but you think you are pretty good, did you compose a masterpiece but you don't think a recordable will ever answer your emails or do you want to discuss the new Miley Cyrus song? Then RHAPSODY is your new best friend!
</p>

<p>
RHAPSODY is set up so that you can share, listen and discuss music in any way you like. RHAPSODY lets you create your own account and with this account you can post your music and comment on any news or track. You can also create a topic or ask a question on a page which is more centered on a specific genre or instrument. RHAPSODY is made so that artists, record labels and music lovers can come together and share their love for music.
